## Names and NetIDs


### Planning Questions

* What behaviors (methods) should the turtle have?

* When does parsing need to take place and what does it need to start
  properly?

* What is the result of parsing and who receives it?

* When are errors detected and how are they reported?

* What do commands know, when do they know it, and how do they get it?

* How is the GUI updated after a command has completed execution?

* What behaviors does the result of a command need to have to be used
  by the front end?

#### Use Cases

* The user types 'fd 50' in the command window, sees the turtle move in the display window leaving a trail, and has the command added to the environment's history.

* The user types '50 fd' in the command window and sees an error message that the command was not formatted correctly.

* The user types 'pu fd 50 pd fd 50' in the command window and sees the turtle move twice (once without a trail and once with a trail).

* The user changes the color of the environment's background.
